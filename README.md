# Netflix Fullscreen Launcher
This app was made to be used with Steam Big Picture or some other type of HTCP software.
Since the windows app for Netflix didn't start in fullscreen, this program automatically enters fullscreen when it launches the Netflix app.
Looks like the app can't enter fullscreen anymore so that part no longer works.
